\nIt’s your responsibility to backup your Secret Key and keep it private. Never show it to anyone. If it’s lost, forgotten or stollen your funds can be used by the person who has your Secret key.
\nDo not jailbreak your phone, do not install apps from unknown (untrusted) sources, do not give your device to untrusted people, and keep the Operating System on your phone up to date. The security of your wallet depends on this.
\nThe entire code powering this app been open to the public scrutiny since the beginning. We tried to build the most secure and decentralized wallet we could, however there are no guarantees that there are no unintended software issues. That said, this wallet is likely to be significantly more secure than any smartphone wallet app out there.
