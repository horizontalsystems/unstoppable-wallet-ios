## Independent & Decentralized

The BANK wallet is fully peer-to-peer and works without any centrally managed servers. It can't be stopped, blocked or taken down. The wallet connects directly to the currency networks i.e. Bitcoin without the need for intermediary. Such approach enables the BANK wallet to operate anywhere and remain censoship-resitant. Only the user is in control of the money.

Most crypto wallet apps out there are centralized. The funds are stored on a remote server which is operated by the wallet provider. Due to the unregulated nature of the cryptocurrencies there are no mechanisms in place to guarantee that a wallet provider doesn't cheat or that provider's servers not get hacked.

Being a fully decentralized app the BANK wallet implements all of its functionality in a decentralized manner. Every single feature in the app in the app is implemented in a decentralized manner substantially increasing the security and privacy aspects of the wallet. 

There are no centrally managed servers that can fail and as a result stop app from functioning.

## Secure & Open Source

The entire code of the BANK wallet is public and open-source giving an option for anyone to analyze all of its code. It works exactly as shown in the code. It can't cheat!

The BANK wallet stores user's private keys and funds encrypted on a device itself using secure native storage mechanisms provided by iOS and Android operating systems. Only user can access and use his or her funds.

Due to the fact that the BANK Wallet keeps user's funds on the device itself there are no online servers or databases that can be hacked.

In case of a device loss or replacement the user may easily restore the wallet using a secret 12-word recovery phrase. Infact, with the help of these secret phrase the user may restore the wallet and access funds on any deterministic wallet (aka HD wallet) not just the BANK wallet app.

**NOTE:** DO NOT recommend install BANK wallet on jailbroken devices due to substantial security risks. A jailbroken iOS or Android operating system can not guarantee the securely of your private keys. This means that some malicious app running on jailbroken device can potentially access the private keys for your funds and steal them.
