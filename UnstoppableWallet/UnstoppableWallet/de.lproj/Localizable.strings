It's what makes your wallet app show you past transactions and calculate your balance. You only gotta do this once when you're resurrecting a wallet.
\n\nNow, there are two ways %@ wallet can pull this off:\n\nFrom the API Server: Think of this like a magic server that's got the entire blockchain data prepped and optimized for a quick download. It's fast but might be a bit less private, and it relies on that third-party server's availability. But it's the go-to option for speed demons ‚Äì takes just 5-10 minutes.\n\nFrom the Blockchain: This is the decentralized route. The app reaches out to a network of blockchain nodes, pinging them for data. It's slower, like a crypto snail's pace, and can take 2-3 hours. But it's independent and works in any situation.\n\nSo, choose wisely, my crypto explorer ‚Äì fast and potentially less private, or slow but steady and fully decentralized. The choice is yours!";

So, we rely on third-party RPC service providers like Infura.io. It's like having a crypto interpreter ‚Äì your communication isn't decentralized, but your funds are all good.\n\nDon't worry, we're on it!
