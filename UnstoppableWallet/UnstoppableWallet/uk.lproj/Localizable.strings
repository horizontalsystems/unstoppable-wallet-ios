It is a process of getting transaction history for a given cryptocurrency so the wallet app is able to display past transactions and calculate the user's balance. This needs to happen only once when the user restores previously created wallets.\n\nAt this point, there are two potential ways for a mobile wallet like Unstoppable to do this:\n\n1. from the API Server: There is a third-party predefined server that hosts the entire blockchain and has all the data processed and optimized to provide that data in a fast manner. This method is fast but potentially (not necessarily) less private. It's also a centralized method to restore a wallet as it depends on the availability of a 3rd party server. This option is recommended due to its speed of getting data (5-10 minutes).\n\n2. from Blockchain: The app tries to restore directly from a network of the blockchain nodes. This is a decentralized way to restore wallet balance and past transactions. The app pings many of the network nodes and requests data from them without addressing some nodes specifically. This option is slow and can easily take 2-3 hours, the app needs to be open while restoring is happening. This restore method doesn't depend on any entity and should work in all conditions.";

One output is the amount that goes to the receiver and the other is the change output that is returned to the sender. The way most wallets construct transactions makes it easy for a third party to understand which of the outputs went to the receiving party and which one was the change amount returned to the sender. As the output returned to the sender is later used in future transactions, a connection between these two transactions becomes apparent.\n\nThe Unstoppable wallet implements measures to make it harder for someone to figure out which output goes where.\n\nThere are two options available to Unstoppable users:\n\n1. Shuffle: The order of transaction outputs is randomized on every transaction. Sometimes change can be the first output, sometimes it can be the second. If a user trusts the developer of the app, then consider this a recommended option.\n\n2. Deterministic: There is a commonly agreed standard for ordering transaction outputs (known as BIP69). In open-source wallets, that standard ensures wallet users do not need to trust how developers of the app implement the ordering of the outputs. As this standard is new, not many wallets have implemented it yet. As a result, it's somewhat possible to see on the blockchain whether a transaction was sent from a wallet that uses that standard or not.";

Unstoppable pings many nodes and communicates with one of them. Each time the app connects to a different node.\n\nIn the case of Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, and other EVM blockchains, there are no alternatives for mobile wallets to interact with respective blockchains other than via third-party RPC service providers (i.e. Infura.io) or personal nodes. That essentially means your communication with that blockchain is not decentralized. This doesn't impact your funds in any way, only the ability to connect to the blockchain network.\n\nRest assured, we are keeping this on the radar and will soon try to provide a decentralized way to sync.
