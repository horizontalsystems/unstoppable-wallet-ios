Thus, the total fee depends on the total size of the transaction which is measured in bytes.\n\nUsers may use provided controls to increase or decrease the fee rate value. The change in fee rate changes the total fee for the transaction the user will pay.\n\nSetting fee rate below recommended value may result in a transaction being held as pending for hours, or being rejected.

It is a process of getting transaction history for a given cryptocurrency so the wallet app is able to display past transactions and calculate the user's balance. This needs to happen only once when the user restores previously created wallets.\n\nAt this point, there are two potential ways for a mobile wallet like Unstoppable to do this:\n\n1. from the API Server: There is a third-party predefined server that hosts the entire blockchain and has all the data processed and optimized to provide that data in a fast manner. This method is fast but potentially (not necessarily) less private. It's also a centralized method to restore a wallet as it depends on the availability of a 3rd party server. This option is recommended due to its speed of getting data (5-10 minutes).\n\n2. from Blockchain: The app tries to restore directly from a network of blockchain nodes. This is a decentralized way to restore wallet balance and past transactions. The app pings many of the network nodes and requests data from them without addressing some nodes specifically. This option is slow and can easily take 2-3 hours, the app needs to be open while restoring is happening. This restore method doesn't depend on any entity and should work in all conditions.";

That essentially means your communication with that blockchain is not decentralized. This doesn't impact your funds in any way, only the ability to connect to the blockchain network.\n\nRest assured, we are keeping this on the radar and will soon try to provide a decentralized way to sync.
