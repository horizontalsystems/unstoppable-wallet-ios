This method is fast but potentially (not necessarily) less private. It's also a centralized method to restore a wallet as it depends on the availability of a 3rd party server. This option is recommended due to its speed of getting data (5-10 minutes).\n\n2. from Blockchain: The app tries to restore directly from a network of blockchain nodes. This is a decentralized way to restore wallet balance and past transactions. The app pings many of the network nodes and requests data from them without addressing some nodes specifically. This option is slow and can easily take 2-3 hours, the app needs to be open while restoring is happening. This restore method doesn't depend on any entity and should work in all conditions.";

That essentially means your communication with that blockchain is not decentralized.
