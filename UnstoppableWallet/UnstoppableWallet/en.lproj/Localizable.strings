The output returned to the sender can then be used in future transactions and further reveal the details to the monitoring party.\n\nUnstoppable wallet implements measures to makes it significantly harder to figure out which output goes where. There are two options available to Unstoppable users:\n\n1. Shuffle : The order of transaction outputs are randomized on every transaction. Sometimes change can be the first output, sometimes it can be the second. If a user trusts the developer of the app, than consider this a recommended option.\n\n2. Deterministic : There is a commonly agreed standard for ordering transaction outputs (known as BIP69). In open source wallets that standard ensures that wallet users do not need to trust how developers of the app implement the ordering of the outputs. As this standard is new, not many wallets have implemented it yet. As a result, it's somewhat possible to see on the blockchain whether transaction was sent from the wallet that uses that standard or not.";

In case of Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin and Dash it is fully peer to peer. The app pings many nodes and communicates with them. Potentially these nodes can record IP address and data requested but since they are chosen randomly, each time the app connects to a different node.\n\nIn case of Ethereum, there is no alternative for mobile wallets to interact with blockchain other than via third party providers (i.e. Infura.io) or personal Ethereum nodes. Third party services can potentially record IP addresses and the requests made. That info can reveal location, balance, transactions etc. Moreover, the wallet has to trust that information returned is correct. There is a an alternative known as Incubed which in essence is a network of special Ethereum nodes. These nodes can also record IP addresses and requests made, but they are chosen randomly each time. While being slightly slower than Infura, the way Incubed works pretty much guarantees that the information returned is correct (not fake).\n\nWhen it comes to other blockchains like EOSIO and Binance Chain, at this point they only provide centralized means of connecting, without viable alternatives. Potentially they can be recording IP addresses and requests made.";

It is a process of getting transactions history for a given coin so that the wallet app is able to display past transactions and calculate user's balance. This needs to happen only once, when user restores previously created wallet. At this point there are two potential ways for a mobile wallet like Unstoppable to do this:\n\n1. from API Server : There is a third-party predefined server which hosts the entire blockchain and has all the data processed and ready to provide it in a fast manner. This method is fast but can potentially keep track of the IP addresses and the data requested. This option is recommended due to its speed of getting data (5-10 minutes). The risks are minimal. If the user restoring from his own server then no privacy risks at all.\n\n2. from Blockchain : In this case the app tries to restore directly from a p2p network of the blockchain nodes. The app pings many of those nodes and requests data from them. Potentially these nodes can keep track of user's IP address and requests made however during restore the app can switch between nodes. There are close to 10,000 Bitcoin nodes on the network at any given time. This option is slow and can easily take 2-3 hours, app needs to be open while restore is happening...";
